# Learning Data with Google

Free access to the Google professional certificates on Coursera were given to me as a perk of my [Data Analytics fellowship with COOP Careers!](https://github.com/alyssarose05/COOP) 
During my fellowship and onwards, I worked on certifications in Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, and Advanced Data Analytics. I gained skills with Excel, Tableau, R, Jupyter Notebook, and Python with projects created by the Coursera programs.
